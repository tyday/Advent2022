Let's see how far we get through Advent Of Code this year

## About AoC
Advent of code is a coding puzzle. One puzzle per day, two parts per puzzle. 
First part of the puzzle is usually easier than the second. Think of it as an introduction to a data puzzle.
The second part usually requires some sort of optimiztion to make it work correctly.

Highly recommended! It's my favorite coding puzzle game.
